I. Offload:
	[Done] 1. Host load balancing. ***
	2. Data transfer decreasing. *
	3. Offload in more former parts, e.g subtree consturction.

II. Performance:
	[Done] 1. Elliminate memory R/W contention, why more MPI procs runs faster? **
	[Done] 2. Queue management optimization for multithread, using lock if nessesary, but make it as little harmful as to the performance. ***
	3. Try better walking tree and processing cell model. *
	4. Thread load balancing, with work stealing? 
	5. Why task parallization not scale well? Try data parallel? **

III. Runtime:
	[Ignore] 1. Thread task model optimization, TEAM+MASTER+SLAVE is OK? **
	2. Thread running model optimization, using thread pool?

IV. Correctness:
	[Done] 1. PM calculation failed when bigger than 16 procs. **
	[Give up] 2. Why we need sleep 2 seconds before ppkernel in slave thread? ***
	[Done] 3. Copy the data back to the host. ***
	4. Integrate the time stepping procedure and check the correctness.
