Changes from last update to August 25, 2014:
-----------------------------------------------
    1. A new balanced tree processing method with mutex lock, mixed with the old source, switching by the 'BIGQUEUE' define in 'data.h'.
    2. Host co-operation with MIC, using 'split' to make the static load balancing.
    3. Data copy back, with file checking (file output was commented now).
    4. Warming process for data transfering.
    5. Eliminated the bug on subcuboid construction.
    6. Border particles processing and corresponding balancing strategy fixing.
    7. Moving the PM procedure to former place of border particles processing.
    8. Thread affinity (commented yet because harmful to performance now).
    9. More timing triggers.
   10. Seperated ppkernel testing, vector alignment pragma added.
   11. Makefile modification.
