-----------------------------------------------
	1. Correcting the two mistakes in PP calculation.
	2. Correcting a cell search algorithm in DTT traversal.
	3. Fixing the issues of mesh masking and adjoining particle processing.
	4. Adding the verifying scheme and ppverify program, using NMK_PP_VERIFY and NMK_GEN_VER_FILE macros to enable it.

Changes from last update to Januray 23, 2015:
-----------------------------------------------
	1. Redesign of the basic data structure, for particles, domains.
	2. Using input file instead of program varibles.
	3. A new global simulation procedure.
	4. Local particles are stored seperatedly from adjoining ones, but two parts are memory successively.
	5. Rewrote the traversal procedure, more tuning options for MIC.
	6. Added the coefficient in PP calculation.
	7. Cleaning the head files.
	8. Added the development reference documentation file.
	9. Other forgotten minor changes, see FIXES file.

Changes from last update to August 25, 2014:
-----------------------------------------------
    1. A new balanced tree processing method with mutex lock, mixed with the old source, switching by the 'BIGQUEUE' define in 'data.h'.
    2. Host co-operation with MIC, using 'split' to make the static load balancing.
    3. Data copy back, with file checking (file output was commented now).
    4. Warming process for data transfering.
    5. Eliminated the bug on subcuboid construction.
    6. Border particles processing and corresponding balancing strategy fixing.
    7. Moving the PM procedure to former place of border particles processing.
    8. Thread affinity (commented yet because harmful to performance now).
    9. More timing triggers.
   10. Seperated ppkernel testing, vector alignment pragma added.
   11. Makefile modification.
